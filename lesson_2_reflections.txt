Question: What happens when you initialise a repository? Why do you
		need to do it?

Initialisation sets up the files you will need to manage the Git 
repository.

Question: How is the staging area different from the working directory
		and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows us to indentify which files we want to include
(rather than everyting in the working directory).
